## TypeScript TodoBox

### Overview:
  - The goal was to build a simple one page todo list using TypeScript. When the page loads it populates with a user, 'Travis', who already has a few items on his list. From there he can add to the list and cross things off the list. 
  
## Setup:
  - Copy the link to clone the repo
  - Run `git clone` in the terminal
  - Run `npm start` and then you add or cross off items
  - Item do not persist on reload
